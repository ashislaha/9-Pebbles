Initially 9 pebbles are given to both player. Aim is to create a Straight Line either Horizontally or Vertically. When a Straight line is created, you claim a pebble from Opposition that must not belongs to a Straight line.

When all pebbles are placed on desk, single movements starts. You will get 4 options "Left"/"Right"/"Top"/"Bottom" to move your pebble to create a Straight line.
